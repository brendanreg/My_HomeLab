# My_HomeLab
Started 11/15/2023

I decided to start small with my lab. Being limited in space and having roommates has its constraints. Additionally, at the time of writing I still consider myself to be a beginner in the realm of information technology, and acquainting myself with highly affordable technologies seems like a nice enough idea to me. With that being said, the first step is acquiring the necessary hardware for my project. So let's begin.

## Parts List
The following is a parts list for my lab **at the time of writing 11/16/2023**
### * Raspberry Pi 4B (8GB)
### * Stackable Raspberry Pi Case with fan/heatsink
### * 128 MicroSD card
### * Power adapter
